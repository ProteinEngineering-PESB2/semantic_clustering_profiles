These include Leu- and Met-enkephalin, dynorphin and neoendorphin, alpha, beta, gamma and delta endorphins formed from beta-lipotropin, various pronase-resistant peptides such as beta casamorphin, and other peptides whose opiate-like action seems to be indirect."
GO:0001512,dihydronicotinamide riboside quinone reductase activity,"Catalysis of the reaction: 1-(beta-D-ribofuranosyl)-1,4-dihydronicotinamide + a quinone = 1-(beta-D-ribofuranosyl)nicotinamide + a hydroquinone."
GO:0001511,obsolete fibrillin,OBSOLETE. Large glycoprotein that is a calcium binding component of connective tissue microfibrils containing 34 six-cysteine (EGF-like) repeats and five eight-cysteine (TGFbeta-1 binding protein-like) repeats. Defects associated with Marfan syndrome.
GO:0001509,obsolete legumain activity,OBSOLETE. Catalysis of the hydrolysis of proteins and small-molecule substrates at Asn-Xaa bonds.
GO:0001598,obsolete chemokine receptor-like receptor activity,OBSOLETE. (Was not defined before being made obsolete).
GO:0001597,obsolete apelin-like receptor,OBSOLETE. (Was not defined before being made obsolete).
GO:0001596,angiotensin type I receptor activity,"An angiotensin receptor activity that acts via Gq-mediated activation of phospholipase C followed by phosphoinositide hydrolysis and Ca2+ signaling, and may act via additional signaling mechanisms."
GO:0001595,angiotensin receptor activity,Combining with angiotensin to initiate a change in cell activity.
GO:0001594,trace-amine receptor activity,"Combining with a trace amine to initiate a change in cell activity. Trace amines are biogenic amines that are synthesized from aromatic amino acids and are substrates for monoamine oxidase, and are therefore detectable only at trace levels in mammals."
GO:0001591,"dopamine neurotransmitter receptor activity, coupled via Gi/Go",Combining with the neurotransmitter dopamine and activating adenylate cyclase via coupling to Gi/Go to initiate a change in cell activity.
GO:0001588,"dopamine neurotransmitter receptor activity, coupled via Gs",Combining with the neurotransmitter dopamine and activating adenylate cyclase via coupling to Gs to initiate a change in cell activity.
GO:0001587,Gq/11-coupled serotonin receptor activity,Combining with serotonin and transmitting the signal across the membrane by activation of the Gq/11 subunit of an associated cytoplasmic heterotrimeric G protein complex. The Gq/11 subunit subsequently activates phospholipase C and results in an increase in inositol triphosphate (IP3) levels.
GO:0001586,Gi/o-coupled serotonin receptor activity,Combining with serotonin and transmitting the signal across the membrane by activation of the Gi/o subunit of an associated cytoplasmic heterotrimeric G protein complex. The Gi/o subunit subsequently inhibits adenylate cyclase and results in a decrease in cyclic AMP (cAMP) levels.
GO:0001584,obsolete rhodopsin-like receptor activity,OBSOLETE. A G protein-coupled receptor that is structurally/functionally related to the rhodopsin receptor.
GO:0001409,guanine nucleotide transmembrane transporter activity,"Enables the transfer of guanine nucleotides (GMP, GDP, and GTP) from one side of a membrane to the other."
GO:0001406,glycerophosphodiester transmembrane transporter activity,"Enables the transfer of glycerophosphodiesters from one side of a membrane to the other. Glycerophosphodiesters are small molecules composed of glycerol-3-phosphate and an alcohol, for example, glycerophosphoinositol."
GO:0015997,obsolete ubiquinone biosynthetic process monooxygenase activity,OBSOLETE. (Was not defined before being made obsolete).
